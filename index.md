## What is Shift Left Security Ltd?

Shift Left Security Ltd is a Cyber Security Consultancy based in London. We focus on helping organisations strengthen their security posture by shifting security further left in the _Software Development Lifecycle_

## What does 'shifting security left' actually mean?

Shifting security left simply means that security is thought about and built into the Software Development Lifecycle at a much earlier stage; ideally before a single line of code has been written.

The goal is to mitigate the risk of security vulnerabilities making their way to the end of the development lifecycle where is it the most costly, inefficient and time-consuming to make fixes.
